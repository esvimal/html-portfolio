        <h3>PATENT DETAILS </h3>
        <h3>Transradial Prosthetic Lower Arm (2025)</h3>
        <p>The present design relates to a transradial prosthetic lower arm intended for individuals with below-elbow limb 
loss. The prosthesis is configured to replicate natural hand movements by enabling finger flexion and extension, 
thumb abduction and adduction, and wrist flexion and extension. The integration of these functions allows for 
enhanced biomechanical performance, improved user control, and increased functionality in daily activities. The 
design emphasises comfort, lifelike usability, and improved quality of life for amputees.</p>

<h3>Humanoid Robotic Hand for Finger Flexion and Extension (2024)</h3>
<p>The present invention pertains to a humanoid robotic hand designed to provide cost-effective prosthetic 
functionality. The hand is configured to perform finger flexion and extension in combination with thumb 
abduction and adduction to achieve improved grasp versatility. The design incorporates lightweight structural 
materials, servo-controlled actuation, and a simplified control interface. Through the application of bio-inspired 
mechanics, the device closely mimics natural hand motion, thereby enhancing dexterity, grip efficiency, and 
adaptability across a range of tasks. This invention addresses the gap between high-cost advanced prosthetics 
and limited-function alternatives, promoting inclusivity and independence for users.</p>
